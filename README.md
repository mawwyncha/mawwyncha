# 🎮 Maulida's Pixel Haven Portfolio

A 3D-inspired, pixel-art themed portfolio with a pastel "Game UI" aesthetic. Built with React and Tailwind CSS using a no-build ESM architecture.

## 🚀 How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

This portfolio is designed to be "plug-and-play." You don't need to install Node.js or build anything.

1.  **Create a Repository:** Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `portfolio`).
2.  **Upload Files:** Upload all the files in this project (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, `constants.tsx`, etc.) to the main branch.
3.  **Enable Pages:**
    *   Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch."
    *   Select the `main` branch and the `/(root)` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.
4.  **Visit your site:** After a minute, GitHub will provide a link (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`).
